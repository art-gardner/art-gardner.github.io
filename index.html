<h1>Spring Cleaning</h1>
<pre>
Decluttering, rationalising, organising,
To sort through everything that has piled up from the year before

this is an act of spring cleaning, 
of airing a years worth of emotion
these feelings mean little to me now, 
words that weighed so heavy when written
now tossed out so lightly

and as i set up my stall in the car boot sale
i hope you can take these scraps home
and love them like i once thought i could</pre>
