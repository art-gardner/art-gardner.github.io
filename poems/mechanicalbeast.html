<title>The Mechanical Beast</title>

<pre>

A mechanical beast once rode through this vllage
It huffed and puffed as it came
I hoped these tracks would never be the same

The snaps I stole I lined on my sheds shelves
My pride and joy, above the models and terrain,
my own station
my idols of desire, a mere representation

The village was noticed and new lines were drawn.
Copper cables and wires and antenna
and dreams of a future I never knew.
Among the tired commuters and lost souls,
apathy reigned but frowns were few

Doors locked, lights on, I sit in my shed
I keep their wheels turning,
the time tables ticking, the fires stoked.
Yet I feel the past <a href="../scraps/glare.html">leaking</a>, through
holes it poked

You were never wrong to have wanted,
to have loved, to desire, to gaze into ones eyes
and see a future so bright
You were a fool to have sat at the sation, long into the night,
with the tables changed.
Waiting for a train that would never come.

There are lines not drawn, villages forgotten, tracks overgrown.
You can wander aimlessly for days. Not the old,
a different new. And if we are to ever meet again, old friend,
I hopee we're changed, never to be the same.
