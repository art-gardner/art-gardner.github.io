I awoke one evening
among the weeds of my garden
The other in my dreaming
had morphed, changing, <a href="../scraps/grey.html">waning</a>,
so far from the love I hoped had harden

The night was long, and the tears
rained hard
I tended the bed, uprooted the false,
growth, tending, planting, distracting.
I ached and toiled, but that would
never heal this heart scarred.
Yet the weeds still withered, sprouts still
sprung, flowers flowing into bloom

Sunlight pierced the sky, showering
you into plain sight.
What a delight! to witness the
weeds you compost, the flora I'd
never think of and the flowers
I already have. A garden you'd adore,
I make it your right

I thought it came too fast, the
strangest night. You were still
ablaze, gazed upon, admiration 
lined upto your fence gate.
I looked down at my sorry sight.
My passion had made these piles of
dirt, ruled by loose leaves and
runaway dreams. I'd been eclipsed
and now I must cheat fate.

As the Sun and Moon go their
seperate ways, you wave to me
and I wave back. You can visit
me, for afternoon tea, and I'll
let you know when I am free.

Because I have weeds to wither,
Sprouts to spring and flowers
to flow into bloom
