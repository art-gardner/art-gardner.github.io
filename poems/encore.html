 I'm waiting for a message I dont
want to receive. 
 I told you I never
wanted it like this. When I told
you, I told the truth, no subtext,
no hidden meanings. But when you 
repeat those words, I feel the weight
different in my hands
 The role I never asked to play.
As you twist the knife to where
you thought my heart was.
 "It was fine" I told you, as I
mistook our encore for a bridge.
 All I want is to be in your arms
once more, as friends, as equals,
as a poem never <a href="../winter.html">finished</a>.
