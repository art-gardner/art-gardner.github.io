<h1>spring</h1>
<pre>

The problem with hoarding, the entire point
The clarity comes clear, right on the ceiling
Boxes of emotions, Ignored and disjoint
I live in the past, with all this feeling

A breath of fresh air, like an intrusion
Like this was all a <a href="scraps/forgiveness.html">sin</a>, I must atone
Unpack the old dreams, mouldy delusions
There on the floor, where I once wasn't so alone

Through the window panes, the <a href="scraps/sunset.html">sun shines</a> long
Space to sit and rest and cry and grieve
Put up the shelves, for what may come along
Plants to grow, and books I have yet to read

So I think it is time, for me to <a href="index.html">ask</a>
