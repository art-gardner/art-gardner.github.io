see the last year has
been one in which my <a href="../quotes/question.html">fate</a> has firmly
been out of my hands. Like I'm a 
side character in someone elses 
tragedy. So I hope you understand 
why i must walk away. This isn't
my mess to <a href="blisters.html">untangle</a> and I must
find my own story to tell
