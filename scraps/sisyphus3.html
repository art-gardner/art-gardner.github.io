  I often wonder too, if Camus
ever misses Weil, in the higher
plane she must have ascended
to. An ascetic martyr, she
starved herself in solidarity 
with the occupied French. She
passed away before the Free
French in London could ever put
aside their petty squabbles. The
worst puishment, worse than
any burden itself, is to take
the burden <a href="tore.html">alone</a>. It was 
Camus who saw the war
to the bitter end.</pre>
