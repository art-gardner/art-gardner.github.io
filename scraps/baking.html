<pre>
it was all so sudden
when i made the cake for you
preheating can wait
messy measuring will do

ready set cook
and off i go
i think you'll love it
and id love to bake
nothing more

and so i stick my bare hands
deep into the oven
and as i turned around
you were <a href="adoration.html">gone</a>

just me and this searing tray.
