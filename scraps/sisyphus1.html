 I often wonder if sisyphus
is still pushing his rock up that
hill. If somewhere deep in hell the
gods had determined that no
motral crime deserves infinite
punishment. If after all those 
aoens, as Camus had, he'd 
imagined himself happy, what
happens next? Put out of his
misery he'd spun into boundless
joy, how does one feel now?
 If Camus had been there to
greet him at the foot of the hill
on the first day of his <a href="../quotes/interruption.html">hellish
freedom</a>, I'm sure they'd agree.
That thre's no greater moral, <a href="../autumn.html">no
destined future</a>, just a life lived
to the fullest, filled with
purpose
