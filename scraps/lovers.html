a few days after the incident
i had come to check up on you
. your remaining partners had
led you to worlds new, <a href="melancholy.html">kissed</a>
the scars you thought healing
was finished with, poured you
from vessel to vessel forming
and flowing, until your tears
watered the gardens tended by
you all.

my care was not <a href="../quotes/aztec.html">needed</a>
i went home and sat in my bed
with all the thoughts
that stayed in my head
