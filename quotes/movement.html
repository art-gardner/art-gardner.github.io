In Tzuba the expression of movement downward
as expressed by the stationary observer on the 
ground is <i>tlel</i> meaning "less up" and the
movement upward <i>utze</i> meaning "less down".
When movement stops the object is said to be
eiher up (<i>áte</i>) or down (<i>ût</i>) but these carry the
suffix <i>cling</i> to express what is thought of as a
circular journey (however small) completed. So
<i>àtecling</i> expressed an upward journey completed
as <i>utcling</i> a journey downwards. So: <i>ûtcling na tzaba
na nabnana stló, </i> "The bird has landed on the
<a href="../scraps/grey.html">ground</a>."
