Branches

Take one step to the branching trees
a quiet dream set a new life to dream (A)

(A)
calm violents, loose leaf in the breeze
one step to the next, never safe as it seems

a coward may turn and run and cry
let the path take her and bliss all night (B)

(B)
the moss by the track, a place to lie
a quiet death, just peace in hindsight

as the roots twine and she is born anew
a node in natures everlasting divine song (C)

(C) 
pieces of her, from before, just morning dew
she found herself here, beyond right and wrong
(end)

(C)
the love that adored her, she now never knew
a past evaporated, just the shadows cast long
(end)

(B)
but she knows better than where to die
a life spent screaming, born to fight

swords clash, blood spills paint her face
ears ring, wars cry, the chant sings forever (D)

(D)
drums beat harder, frenzied, picking up pace
this crushing weight, this cursed endeavor
(end)

(D)
legs burn, throats sing-scream in place
tether to this mortal coil, never to sever 
(end)

(A)
a blazing fire, a weight on the knees
an ocean, never as shallow as it may seem

the ground trembles, aches, pains and gives way
the fog, blankets, pillows and cushions her fall (E)

(E; stale)
and off she goes, a faint fog, away with the fae
and as the horn blasts, she, for once, can resist a call

or if any stale dreams still lay between the woods
or the past could catch up to this girl runnning slow (F)

(F; dreamt)
it seems all thats left with her is damaged goods
a dream she had once dreamt, caught up in the flow
(end)

(F; scars)
one step after another, soft fear hidden underhoods
after one thousands scars, can survive any blow
(end)

(E; spark)
shut eyes, soft slips, shattered down to lay
down here, dreaming soft, she'll stay small

always a spark that still smothered in moss
nothing she could write could capture that song (G)

(G; solemn)
by the stream, she knows she can never cross
below the leaves, the solemn shadows cast long
(end)

(G; albatross)
from distant shores, she spots an albatross
to follow one step with another, is never wrong
