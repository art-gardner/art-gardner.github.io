<h1>autumn</h1>

<pre>
I dont know <a href="scraps/sisyphus2.html">who</a> to write my letters to anymore
If my hands could ever resolve this
If the closing words could ever leave my lips

I am a <a href="scraps/passenger.html">passenger</a> to my own misfortune
Front row seats in this tragedy
I mistook this bridge for an encore
discordant and unresolved

we are threads in this this divine <a href="branches/branch.html">tapestry</a>
we tap and touch and tear and tear
and when we weave i hope we weave together
A masterpiece, my standing ovation
