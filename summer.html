<h1>summer</h1>
<pre>
a peace and quiet
in a noisy cafe
a book to read
in your company

waiters crawl
across the crowd
<a href="poems/bus.html">waitings fine</a>
across from you

a book so good
one must put it down
a moment <a href="poems/mechanicalbeast.html">savoured</a>
a minute at a time

why should i skip to the final chapter?
how could I sip a finished tea?
</pre>
